Do to all the above you have any good reason to do what ever posibe to stop Google
 from having any access to any parts of your Internet connected devices.

The worst of them are `safebrowsing.google.com` which is implamentd into almost
any modern browser, and nearly imposible to get rid of. `safebrowsing.google.com` 
Is not to protect you, but to protect Google's business by collecting all you
internet activites, nothing more, nothing less. Google isn't for you, you are 
the `Google`'s product, don't ever forget that. Everything Google do "for you"
is ***BAIT*** to get you stucked in a zombie mode for easies brainwashing and
manipulation.
